### Project Overview

This example includes an implementation of a program to control a LEGO car, using an Android smartphone as the joystick.  

You can find the sample Android application [here]([link_to_android_app](https://github.com/czuryk/Lego/tree/main/PyBricks/BLE/Android)).

### Features

This program implements functions for controlling a LEGO car, including steering and movement. It also transmits data to the smartphone, such as distance sensor readings and gyroscope data.

Key functionalities:  
- Upon connecting to the hub, the program starts automatically.  
- When disconnected from the hub, the program terminates to allow reconnection via BLE.
